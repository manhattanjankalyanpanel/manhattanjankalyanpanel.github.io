# 🏢 Manhattan Building Image Setup Instructions

## 📸 How to Add Your Manhattan Building Images

I've integrated your beautiful Manhattan Society building into the website! Here's how to complete the setup:

### Step 1: Save Your Building Image
1. **Save the building image** you shared as: `manhattan-building.jpg`
2. **Place it in the `images` folder** (already created for you)

### Step 2: File Structure
```
manhattan-campaign/
├── images/
│   └── manhattan-building.jpg  ← Save your building image here
├── photos/
│   ├── krishna-tripathi.jpg
│   ├── amol-arsad.jpg
│   └── ... (other team photos)
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

### Step 3: Building Image Placement
Your building image is now displayed in **two strategic locations**:
1. **Hero section** - Replaces the placeholder building with the real Manhattan Society
2. **Contact section** - Shows the actual building where residents can reach you

### Step 4: Banner Features
✅ **Responsive design** - scales perfectly on all devices  
✅ **Hover effects** - subtle animation when users hover over it  
✅ **Professional styling** - rounded corners, shadows, and borders  
✅ **Perfect placement** - positioned above the "Vote For STAR" message  

### Alternative Placements
If you want to use the banner elsewhere too, I can add it to:
- Section headers
- Footer
- Contact page
- As a background element

### Quick Setup
1. Save your banner image as `manhattan-banner.jpg`
2. Put it in the `images` folder
3. Refresh your browser
4. Your professional banner will appear in the hero section!

### Image Requirements
- **Recommended format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended size**: 800x400 pixels (or similar ratio)
- **File size**: Under 1MB for fast loading
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display
